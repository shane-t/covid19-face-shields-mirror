## Shields for heroes

We are using the European 3DVerkstan headband with the Prusa bottom reinforcement. The headband is 3d printable with PETG or PLA, and the shield part can be made with acetate (150+ micron preferred, thicker is better)

### You will need

- 3d printer and filament
- Hole punch (ideally an adjustable hole punch capable of punching A6)
- Transparent plastic, ideally A4 size

If you don't have transparencies or the hole punch, you should still print the headbands, as there are solutions in the works to produce the shields separately.

### Creating the shield

Until laser cut versions of the shield plastic are available, you can use transparent cellulose acetate from office suppliers, used in binding or overhead projection transparencies.

#### Obtaining acetate

- [Q-Connect 200 micron acetate](https://www.theofficecentre.ie/q-connect-clear-a4-pvc-binding-covers-250-micron-pack-of-100-kf24011--5?fbclid=IwAR05Gf-6n0NugTUoxUMnn7gsRlD37Dx_0PgHNm7_RDUdI0YSgFI4KmAjmLU%C3%A1) from the office centre (Courier delivery)
- [150 Micron binding covers](https://www.huntoffice.ie/5-star-office-comb-binding-covers-pvc-150-micron-a4-clear-pack-100-916345.html) from huntoffice.ie

#### Preparing the acetate (Work in Progress)

You cam follow the instructions on the [3dverkstan page](https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/protective-visor-versions/). Follow the instructions for the European version. 

- TODO: Add a video of the acetate being prepared.

#### Shield Assembly

- [Printout for assembling face shields](pdf/how-to-assemble-face-shield.pdf) that you can include with shipments of unassembled face shields

### What to do with completed shields (Work in progress)

- Contact local healthcare centres and establish the demand for face shields
- You should label your shields "CUSTOM"
- Follow the conversation in the facebook and slack groups
- See the OSV-X slack channel [#urgent\_appeals\_volunteersneeded](https://app.slack.com/client/T01049EC3AN/C010FFHV5FC/) to find where help is needed the most
- See the OSV-X slack channel [#legal\_regulatory\_information group](https://app.slack.com/client/T01049EC3AN) for a legal disclaimer that should be signed by a healthcare centre
- Contact info@covidcommunityresponse.ie and arrange transport of the PPE to healthcare centres
